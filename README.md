# Description

#### My favorite framework and it's being used in this project:
- [Nest](https://docs.nestjs.com) is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications.
#### Docs of the two libraries I used:
- [Telegram](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) is an HTTP-based interface created for developers keen on building bots for Telegram.
- [Discord](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/main) is a powerful Node.js module that allows you to easily interact with the Discord API.
